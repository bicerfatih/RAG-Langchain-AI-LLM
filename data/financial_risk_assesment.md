##### Abstract: Financial soundness of banking sector is certainly spine of every economy. Failure of giant banks devastates

##### not only the domestic economy but it also puts the globe at wager. The best example of this is collapse of Lehman

##### brothers in 2008. In this milieu, it is very crucial to investigate the financial soundness of domestic banks. New

##### economic policy, 1991 have significantly changed the facade of Banking Industry in India.The keeping money industry

##### has invigorated gradually from a controlled situation to a deregulated showcase economy.Bankingindustry is exposed

##### to different types of risks. Risk is defined as anything that can generate hindrances in the way of attainment of certain

##### objectives. In the present study researcher has focussed on the determinants of riskiness of the Indian banking sector

##### and various measures taken by RBI to curb the risk. A secondary data review reveals that the Indian commercial

##### banks are exposed to different risks such as liquidity risk, interest risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, market risk

##### ,operational risks etc. Different studies have applied different analysis techniques for assessing the riskiness such as

##### Altman’s Z Score, GAP Analysis, Data Envelopment Analysis, Tobit- Regression Model, Back Propogation Neural

##### Network, Black Scholes-Merton option valuation, ANOVA, CAMEL Model, Sensitivity Analysis etc. The recent

##### regulatory practices of RBI to curb such risk have been assessed. The literature review reveal that an empirical study

##### needs to be done to analyse all the parameters affecting the banking industry. Moreover, the future research needs to

##### be conducted in exploring alternative techniques for developing risk management scores.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

## The growth & development of an economy depends upon the performance of its banking sector as it’s the major

## source of finance in the economy. Ever since New Economic Policy, 1991 is introduced by Dr.Manmohan Singh

## there is great transformation in the Indian Banking sector. There is shift from a regulated market economy to a

## deregulated market economy in the banking sector. Moreover the financial crisis had a significant impact on the

## Indian Banking Sector. Therefore to sustain financial soundness of a bank in long run, there is dire necessity to

## focus on risk & distress in banking sector. Risk is prevalent in all business, so is in bank. “Risk refers to a

## condition where there is a possibility of undesirable occurrence of a particular result which is known or best

## quantifiable and therefore insurable”. In the pre reform era the banks have used risk control system to adjust

## with the legal environment but after entering into deregulated market economy,the Indian commercial banks are

#### exposed to varied of types risks such as liquidity risk, operational risks, solvency risk, credit risk, interest rate

#### risk, market risk, foreign exchange risk, etc. Therefore it’s imperative to develop an effective risk management

#### approach consisting of risk determination, risk assessment and risk minimisation. Inability to formulate such

#### system will have negative effect on the financial soundness of business and will lead to increased probability of

#### bankruptcy in banks. Risk management is a future oriented process, which begins with risk identification, risk

#### estimation, risk planning, risk controlling or minimising. Through this research work, the researcher has attempted

#### to review literature relating risk determination, risk assessment and risk minimisation. In the year 1994, The

#### Board for Financial Supervision (BFS), a body governed by RBI has transformed reforms so as to make the

#### Banks economically more viable & financially stronger. Since 1999, the rating of Indian banks were done using

#### CAMELS Model & of foreign banks using CACS Model. In 1977, Altman & in 1988 Hannan&Hanweck

#### developed Z-Score model to determine the insolvency of small scale units which was later applied to banks to

#### judge there probability of insolvency/ bankruptcy. The Z-Score measure showed approximately 70 % accuracy

#### giving results. As far as present scenario is concerned Data Envelopment Analysis Model & Black Scholes

#### Merton model is used by researchers in assessing the risks of Indian Banks.The present study consist of the

#### following sections. Section 2 describes the objective of the study.Section 3 deals with the research methodology

#### adopted in the study. Section 4 deals with literature review relating to the risks in banking sector. Section 5 is

#### conclusion & finding gap in the present study.

### 2. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

#### The primary aim of this paper is to study the present status of riskiness & distress being exposed to banks by

#### reviewing the past published and unpublished research work on the same topic in a well organised manner to

#### provide quick and easy access to the future researchers of the same field. The paper is attempted to have wider

#### knowledgeof the financial risk assessment of the banks.

#### Another aim of the study is to divide the phase of risk into different segments such as risk assessment &

#### evaluation, risk management and risk minimisation & to evaluate the approaches used to minimise the riskiness

#### in the banking sector. Furthermore, suggestions are provided on the prospects of future research on the same

#### topic.

### 3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### 3.1. Data

#### The paper consist of extensive search of fifty research papers that have studied riskiness & distress of banks

#### published or un published from 2000 to 2016. The classification of various papers from various sources is

#### presented in Table 1. In Table 3A, 3B , 3C ,careful substance investigation dispassionately sorted out and coded

#### the reviews in light of different viewpoints including distribution year, centre of study, technique embraced and

#### the conclusion & findings discovered. Analysis of the resulting data presents an overview of the research and

#### identifies areas for future research.

### 3.2. Methodology

#### This paper is an attempt to present a review of financial riskiness & distress of the banks, published or unpublished,

#### from 2000 to 2016. The writing hunt depended on the catchphrase “Risk & Distress in banks” for chosen

#### databases and sites for the period going from 2000 to 2016. The databases were scanned for the watchwords in

#### the titles, abstracts, catchphrases records and full content. Relevant papers related to banking riskiness and

#### distress are considered for the present study, classification of entire risk can be categorised into following segments;

#### yearly division of research, sources from where the papers are collected and phases in literature review.This

#### paper is a comprehensive snapshot of 50 research papers. Table 1 depicts the yearly division of research.

### 4. ANALYSIS OF EARLIER RESEARCH WORK

#### This section deals with the break up of literature review on the basis of the focus areas of risk evaluation &

#### assessment, risk management and risk minimisation in banking sector.Most of the studies are focusing on risk

#### evaluation & assessment and empirical evidences on their determinants. In spite of the fact that there are studies

#### in this field applying capital adequacy ratio, productivity&profitaibility, liquidity or camel rating, yet the trouble

#### position has not broadly examined Some of the research studies conducted in the arena during last sixteen years

#### are briefly reviewed in Table III(A), (B), (C).

### 4.1. Risk Evaluation & Assessment

#### Table 3Ashows the literature review relating to risk evaluation &assessment by researchers covering national &

#### international scenario.

#### The review of literature of above papers reveals that the researchers have tried to analyse & evaluate the

#### different parameters pertinent to credit risks. However, the reviewed paper does not cover the evaluation of

#### the overall risks in banks & the size of the sample is also limited. Further research could deal with the

#### analysing all the parameters of overall risk exposed to banks & study could also focus on determinants of

#### financial risk. The future research could be based on the consideration of all types of commercial banks

#### including private sector banks and public sector banks. Finally the study can be performed on the contribution

#### to systemic risk. The banks should find out the measurement of marginal contribution to the overall risk. The

#### study can focus on the interdependency or interrelationship between capital, risks and bank efficiency /

#### profitability of the banks.

##### Financial Risk Assessment and Management by Banks: Evidences from Past Research

#### The review of literature of the above papers concludes that various models have been used by different

#### authors in order to minimise risks. The techniques to minimise risk explored by different authors are

#### sensitivity analysis , to determine how much the valuation of an individual variable changes by varying an

#### independent input ; Altman’s Z –Score, to determine the probability of bankruptcy in banks; Data

#### Envelopment Analysis, to evaluatethe performance of the banks ; Bankometer Model ,to analyse the financial

#### soundness of banks; Black Scholes option Pricing Model, to analyse the market value and riskiness /

#### volatility of bank’s assets etc. The literature further declares that that in order to improve their financial

#### health, Indian banks need to reduce the non-performing loans to a very negligible level and maintain a

#### steady ROA. Moreover, the future research needs to be conducted in exploring alternative techniques for

#### developing risk management scores.

### 5. CONCLUSION &SCOPE FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

#### The study of financial soundness / distress of banking sector is totally inevitable to ensure economic growth &

#### development. The analysis of earlier research work done reveals that since the 1980’s different researchers have

#### being employing different approaches for evaluating , assessing , managing & minimising risk in banking industry.

#### Most popular of all these tools were the CAMEL Model, Credit Risk Model, GAP Analysis, Sensitivity Analysis,

#### Panel Data Approach etc. Other techniques for evaluating distress are Altman’s Z –Score, to determine the

#### probability of bankruptcy in banks; Data Envelopment Analysis, to evaluate the performance of the

#### banks;Bankometer Model to analyse the financial soundness of banks; Black Scholes option Pricing Model, to

#### calculate the market value and riskiness / volatility of bank’s assets etc.

#### The study declares that it is imperative to analyse all the parameters i.e. the micro & macro factors, focusing

#### on both the qualitative & quantitative risk assessment so as to have holistic view regarding the riskiness in banks

#### .Moreover, there is a need to explore alternative techniques for developing risk management scores and expanding

#### the present techniques.

#### Present paper is a compiled review comprising of references for which papers cited may be referred.
